Overview
========
The SMS Framework API allows your modules to take advantage of the convenience
and flexibility of SMS messaging. In most cases your module will fall into one
of two categories.

* Modules that provide integration between the framework and Drupal. Your
  module could provide a feature that could integrate nicely with SMS or your
  module could supplement an existing module with SMS integration.

* Modules that provide intergration between the framework and a third party SMS
  service.

Different parts of the API are used for each of these applications, so it's
important to decide which you'll be building using before you begin.

Writing a Gateway Module
========================
The first step is to tell the SMS Framework about your gateway module using
hook_gateway_info(). Your implentation of this hook should return and array of
properties and callbacks about each gateway. Here is an example:

  function my_gateway_gateway_info() {
    return array(
      'my_gateway' => array(
        'name' => 'My Gateway',
        'send' => 'my_gateway_send',
        'receive' => TRUE,
        'configure form' => 'my_gateway_admin_form',
        'send form' => 'my_gateway_send_form',
      ),
    );
  }
    
* name - Human readable name for the gateway.
* send - Callback function that the SMS Framework will call to send a message
* receive (optional) - Set to true if the gateway has support for handling
  incoming messages
* configure form (optional) - Form function for gateway configuration options
* send form (optional) - Form function for adding gateway-specific fields to
  the sending form

Next you need to write the callback function for sending SMS messages using
your gateway. Using the example from above, our function would look something
like this:

function my_gateway_send($number, $message, $options) {
  // Code for sending message through third party gateway service
}

The callback function is passed the following parameters:
$number - The validated destination number.
$message - The text of the message.
$options (optional) - An array of dditional properties as defined your gateway
module's send form.

The actual contents of the function will depend on the gateway service. Refer
to the gateway's API documentation.
