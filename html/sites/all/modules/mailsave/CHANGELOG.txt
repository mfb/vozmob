Fix security vulnerability in mime allocation. Mailsave now requires
Drupal 6.4 or higher in order to work. Thanks to mfb (user/12302) for
pointing this one out.

Incorporate patch from #291232 to fix menu access argument and tidy up
strings. Thanks to mfb (user/12302).

Error reports of problems using Blackberry devices highlighted that the file
name decoding was being done in the wrong place. New filename decode and
sanitise routine written to ensure child modules are only given usable file
names for processing. Thanks to spanders (drupal.org/user/29009) for putting
me on the right track in post 217516#comment-925326.

A little later than planned, but mailhandler went official a while back, so
mailsave is now ready for an official release. At the moment none of the add
on modules such as mailsave_to_image are ready, but the main image module is
only at alpha stage in any case. The clean up filters are still available so
MMS cleaning is still possible.

05 December 2007
----------------
This is the first development commit of mailsave for Drupal 6. Technically
mailhandler hasn't been officially migrated yet, but using a locally updated
copy this version of mailsave is working.

Not that related mailsave modules, such as mailsave to image, or mailsave to
image field, have not yet been updated as these also require related modules
to be ported to Drupal 6.

28 October 2007
---------------
Discovered that constants defined for mime encoding are in fact already defined
by the IMAP extensions, so no need to create new ones. Mailsave updated to use
them!

23 October 2007
---------------
There are quite a lot of changes in this version of mailsave!

# Optimized for latest mailhandler
Mailhandler has been updated and now extracts mime parts as part of its
retrieval process, and it makes these attachments available via the node.
For users with the latest mailhandler it is therefore not necessary for
mailsave to do its own extraction, which requires a second call to the mail
host. This latest version of mailsave will test for the new mailhandler and
take advantage of it to speed up message processing. Mailhandler later than
5.1.2 (currently therefore only HEAD) is required.

# Unnamed files handled
Unknown files found by mailsave are now assigned the name unnamed_attachment
in order to be consistent with the mailhandler naming convention. At present
this isn't too critical, but will help if future modules were to test for
empty filenames for some reason.

# Mailsave to imagefield
A contributed plug-in that allows mailsave to interact with the CCK imagefield
module was provided by Moonshine (drupal.org/user/133705) and is included in
this release.

# Mailsave to image_attach
A requested plug-in that allows mailsave to use image_attach rather than
forcing conversion to image nodes is included. This can be helpful if you
don't want the original node type to be changed. Instead of making image nodes
out of jpegs a new image node is created and linked to the "parent" node. If
activating the mailsave to image attach module you will want to make sure
mailsave to image is disabled! Also, don't forget to assign appropriate user
permissions (allow images from email to be attached) and enable image attach
for the appropriate content types.

# Mailsave to audio (beta)
This module is still in beta, but it seems to mostly work, so it is included
in this release to see how it gets on. It probably needs some further work
doing, and I'm not sure how many people will really want to post audio via
email/MMS!

# Clean up filters
Some additional clean up filters are added. The filters are still under
development. It seems that the content of MMS emails might vary depending on
the sending handset, which was unexpected. If the filter you need isn't in the
current package you can likely adapt one of the existing filters. If you do
this please consider contributing the filter back to the community. If you
aren't sure how to write a filter then you can post an MMS to the test box at
mailsave@stuartandnicola.com and I'll try to develop one if I get time. Thanks
to those users who sent messages to help create the initial set of filters.

18 October 2007

A sample MMS from Telia showed messages via this network did not make the file
name available via parameters/dparameters, so mailsave did not retrieve it.
Mailsave modified so that it will assign a filename "Unknown" to attachments of
type other than text that don't return a filename. At the same time a Telia
MMS filter was written to retrieve and update the filename for this network.

28 May 2007

Cleanup filters re-engineered so that they no longer appear on the module page
(where the list was getting long!) The filters are now treated as plug-ins and
are written as .inc files. A new mailsave > settings page has been created
which allows the user to turn on/off each plug-in. The list is grouped by
country using ISO country codes - this seems to make most sense since a user
is likely to be receiving most messages from their own locale, so this groups
providers nicely in one place.

The option to have other modules implement clean-up via hook_mailsave_clean is
retained in case, for some reason, someone wanted a plug-in that runs as a
module in its own right (not sure why that would be, but easy enough to leave
in!)

15 May 2007
-----------
As a result of allowing mailsave to store text attachments some of the filters
were acquiring additional text files. Affected clean up filters modified so
that they discard these additional files.

Clean up filters re-named to just mms_xx_yyyyyy where xx is two letter country
identified and yyyyyy is the network name. Things were getting messy as new
filters were added! Filters moved to a subdirectory MMS to keep them neat and
tidy and away from the main module elements.

Sample message received from Meteor (Ireland) - new filter created to handle
this.

14 May 2007
-----------
In developing a clean up filter for O2 realised that mailsave was not
storing text attachments (it was programmed to ignore type text/plain)
This is now changed so any attachment that has a filename is added to the
attachments list, including text types.

23 April 2007
-------------
Beta of mailsave version 2.
Basic modular system is working - now have mailsave.module and
mailsave_to_image.module interacting via hook_mailsave()
New modular system written to handle tidying up of MMS messages, via
hook_mailsave_clean. Use this hook to discard attachments and tidy up
the body on the basis of the service provider. Only tested via
Vodafone (UK) at this time (because that is who I use!)

22 April 2007
-------------
First prototype that uses hook_mailsave to handle file attachments.
Mailsave itself will now just save everything it is supplied with.
A separate module handles the jpeg to image routine, thereby separating
the mailsave function of obtaining attachments, and the handling of content.
Internally $node->attachments renamed to $node->mailsave_attachments to ensure
that attached files are made specific to the mailsave module.

11 April 2007
-------------
Oops - when I copied over the upload validation code I forget to replace
references to form_set_error('upload',...) with watchdog('error',...)
This is now fixed!

17 March 2007
-------------
Upgraded to Drupal 5.x
